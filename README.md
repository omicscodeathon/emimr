## About EMImR

EMImR is a Shiny Application for Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Changes Identification and data correlation.

The application's main function is to identify the intersection between genetic and epigenetic modififcations, including :

* Identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

* Identify the differentially methylated genes (DMGs)  

* Determine DEGs associated with DMGs

* Identify the genes associated to differentially expressed interfering miRNA (GDEImRs).

* Determine DEGs associated with  differentially expressed interfering miRNA

    - all dependencies are installed automatically with the tool
    - Internet requirement: Only if using an online server
    - Third-party tools requirement: R studio or an online Server
    - Pre-requirements: R  installation


## Installation Guide


**Step 1 :** Install dependencies

    Install the latest version of R if your computer does not have it: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)   

            ### How To Install R and RStudio
